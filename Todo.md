## Todo list

1. redux middleware to log actions. establish a diff sync with client and server indices
2. httpsnippet to generate code from request
3. import/export from HAR
4. complete the request creation
5. websocket request to test websocket packet sends
6. For larger files use object urls, and binary sending for memory and performance concerns (maybe later)
7. return request body with response if it there is no binary content (for binary content, just display binary)
8. Assertions for unit testing
